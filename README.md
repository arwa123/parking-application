	After the fall of Mordor, a lot of people from Middle Earth have come and settled in city of Minas Tirith. With increased people in capital, there is traffic chaos throughout the city. To fix the problem, the heir of Isildur, King Ellesar has decided to construct a multi level vehicle parking in the city centre. 
2 Problem Statement 
	You have to design a multi level vehicle parking system which among other features, gives a parking slot number for a given vehicle intending to park. Albus Dumbledore will tweak the system based on his preference to get max throughput of the system. 
3 Key Capabilities 
Below functionalities needs to be considered while designing 
	1. Parking slots closer to the exits. 
	2. Parking slots at lower levels for elderly. 
	3. Convert car parking to bike parking in case of increased traffic from 
	bikes.

	5. Optional Give incentives to car pooled vehicles. 
	6. Optional Offers and discounts to repeat customers. 

4 Specifics 
	The multi level car parking is a super structure. Each floor has the ability to stack vehicles over each other. The floor plan for each stories from 0-N is 

	P P P P P 
	- - - - - 
	P P P P P 
	P P P P P 
	- - - - - 
	P P P P P

	3. Output Vehicle type 
	4. Output Vehicle no 
	Interval Output:
